# Deploy_HUB :

  - There are three services we need to make :
     - Upload Service 
     - Deployment Service
     - Request Handler Service 

     -upload service :
       - Install Node.js
       - Initialise an empty typescript project
       - Basic typescript configuration
       - Add express , redis , aws-sdk , simple-git , cors as dependencies
       - Initialize a simple express app in index listening on port3000-   
       - Initialise an endpoint that the user will hit and send the repo url as input
       - Create a function that randomly generates an id for this session. Call  it generate
       - Use simple-git to clone the repo into a new folder (/out/id ).
       - Write a function that gets the paths of all the files in the /out/id folder
      - Write a function that uploads a file given a path to S3
      - Iterate over all the files and upload them to S3 one by one (or together)
       - Start redis locally { command in cmd for start redis "redis-server.exe"}
      - Initialize a redis publisher
      - Use redis queues to push the uploadId in the queue
      - Also store the current video idâ€™s status as uploaded .
      - Expose a status endpoint that the frontend will poll to get back the status of a video. It needs to check redis for the current value.
